      <description>2017 was a tough one. Nonetheless, big thanks to  for hosting an event.
Challenge: Can you read my mind? No hints.
All you get is an input box:
Checking the page source doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything fruitful. In hindsight the name=&amp;quot;f&amp;quot; may have been a clue, but it&amp;rsquo;s subtle. (spoiler: f for file)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello, what do you want to read?</description>

      <description>Challenge: If you hear enough, you may hear the whispers of a key&amp;hellip;
If you see app.py well enough, you will notice the UI sucks&amp;hellip;
No hints.
PPP (plaid parliament of pwning) puts on one of the best online Jeopardy CTFs. I wish I had more time that weekend (runs for 48hrs only) and a full team, either way I decided to give it a go.
Disclaimer, was not solved within the allotted time.</description>

      <description>Had a blast participating with a few local DC416 folks in the 2017 picoCTF!
Challenge: Can you help me find the data in this littleschoolbus.bmp?
Hint: Look at least significant bit (LSB) encoding!!
In retrospect the solution was fairly straightforward, but, tunnel vision got the best of me. Thankfully in the end I ended up learning quite a bit about steganography and LSB. (disclaimer, it was actually solved by a teammate)</description>

      <description>Challenge: The website isn&amp;rsquo;t really me much, but you can still get the admin password, right?
Hint: Sometimes an error message can be just as useful
This one was really rewarding.
So, the landing page looked like this:
Based on the description we assume the username is admin so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the password field.
Entering a single quote results in an error, great, there is a problem with the query, we know the syntax and it appears to be injectable.</description>

      <description>Challenge: You found a suspicious USB drive in a jar of pickles. It contains this file
$ file freeThePickles.class freeThePickles.class: compiled Java class data, version 52.0 (Java 1.8) Hint: Is there a way to get the source of the program?
Although this challenge didn&amp;rsquo;t call for it, if you want to disassemble a class file use javap like so&amp;hellip;
javap -verbose freeThePickles.class &amp;gt; freeThePickles
Anyways, back to the challenge. I used a &amp;ldquo;cloud-based&amp;rdquo; decompiler, javadecompilers.</description>
