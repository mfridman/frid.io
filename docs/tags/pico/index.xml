      <description>Had a blast participating with a few local DC416 folks in the 2017 picoCTF!
Challenge: Can you help me find the data in this littleschoolbus.bmp?
Hint: Look at least significant bit (LSB) encoding!!
In retrospect the solution was fairly straightforward, but, tunnel vision got the best of me. Thankfully in the end I ended up learning quite a bit about steganography and LSB. (disclaimer, it was actually solved by a teammate)</description>

      <description>Challenge: The website isn&amp;rsquo;t really me much, but you can still get the admin password, right?
Hint: Sometimes an error message can be just as useful
This one was really rewarding.
So, the landing page looked like this:
Based on the description we assume the username is admin so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the password field.
Entering a single quote results in an error, great, there is a problem with the query, we know the syntax and it appears to be injectable.</description>

      <description>Challenge: You found a suspicious USB drive in a jar of pickles. It contains this file
$ file freeThePickles.class freeThePickles.class: compiled Java class data, version 52.0 (Java 1.8) Hint: Is there a way to get the source of the program?
Although this challenge didn&amp;rsquo;t call for it, if you want to disassemble a class file use javap like so&amp;hellip;
javap -verbose freeThePickles.class &amp;gt; freeThePickles
Anyways, back to the challenge. I used a &amp;ldquo;cloud-based&amp;rdquo; decompiler, javadecompilers.</description>
