      <description>Had a blast participating with a few local DC416 folks in the 2017 picoCTF!
Challenge: Can you help me find the data in this littleschoolbus.bmp?
Hint: Look at least significant bit (LSB) encoding!!
In retrospect the solution was fairly straightforward, but, tunnel vision got the best of me. Thankfully in the end I ended up learning quite a bit about steganography and LSB. (disclaimer, it was actually solved by a teammate)</description>
