      <description>Medium has played a big role throughout the tech world since their Welcome to Medium post on Aug 14, 2012.
Unfortunately, I suspect one day Medium will cease to operate (or be acquired at a discount) due to a sluggish revenue model.
But, if Medium does goes kaboom, what happens to that content? Will it all still be available online in some other form? If Medium gets acquired, who&amp;rsquo;ll really own the content?</description>
