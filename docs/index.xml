      <title>Upspin part 2: Configuring an Upspin user</title>

      <description>Intro
 Installing the tools
 1 - Download binaries directly
 2 - Use Go to pull and build
  Creating a user
 Testing your user
  Intro To access data within the Upspin world one does not require a directory or storage server. Think of yourself as a client, i.e., a user, that was granted access to another user&amp;rsquo;s data.
For the sake of this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting a publicly accessible file that any Upspin user can access.</description>

      <title>A mongoDB Go Driver - by the mongoDB folks</title>
      <link>https://frid.io/golang/a-new-mongodb-go-driver/</link>

      <guid>https://frid.io/golang/a-new-mongodb-go-driver/</guid>
      <description>So this is exciting, the mongoDB team is working on an official mongoDB Go driver. The official announcement can be found at MongoDB Go Driver Alpha 1 released
For those interested why mongoDB chose to write a driver from the ground-up as apposed to forking mgo read their engineering blog
The repo can be found on github mongo-go-drive and bug reports should be filed over on jira.mongodb.org
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to give mongoDB a fair shot, and now seems to be the right time.</description>

      <title>Shine on You Crazy Interface - #golang part1</title>

      <description>Go&amp;rsquo;s interfaces are brilliant. It&amp;rsquo;s not immediately apparent and at first can be confusing, but after a while its brilliance shines through.
Simply understand that if a concrete type posses all necessary methods it, the concrete type, can implicitly satisfy an interface.
In Go, interfaces are considered abstract types, meaning we do not know what an interface really is, only what it can do.
The Go standard library makes use of interfaces, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example.</description>

      <description>No interface discussion is complete without talking about the fmt.Stringer interface. This is a classic when introducing the topic of interfaces.
Notice in part1 we actually made use of this interface to format the songs type.
func (s songs) String() string { var ss []string for i := range s { ss = append(ss, s[i].name+&#34; &#34;+fmt.Sprint(s[i].release.Year())) } return strings.Join(ss, &#34;, &#34;) }  When we called a print function the output was nicely formatted:</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t care much for &amp;ldquo;annual&amp;rdquo; events, i.e., taking action x because y rotations around the sun. But, I do believe in allocating time aside for reflecting and setting future goals. It just so happens that time is now, and now is end-of-year.
The meetup game in Toronto continues to be strong. Lots of interesting folks. Meetups I try regularly attend: DC416, Docker-Toronto, Go-Toronto.
A few members of DC416 and I started playing as a Team capturing digital flags.</description>

      <description>Background For some time I imagined a world where all I&amp;rsquo;d need to access my data was something, be it a laptop, cellphone or embedded microchip, that would authenticate me and grant access to all data available to me. In this world I could bring said authentication anywhere, e.g., a library or Chiba City, and start accessing data with whatever tools available. Imagine a keyboard, mouse and monitor at the library or tablet at an airport.</description>

      <title>Validating host keys in Go&#39;s ssh package</title>
      <link>https://frid.io/golang/go-ssh-hostkey/</link>

      <guid>https://frid.io/golang/go-ssh-hostkey/</guid>
      <description>So you upgraded the package: go get -u -v golang.org/x/crypto/...
and got an error: ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback
A quick google search returns this great post Golang SSH Security, as well as issue#19767 and e4e2799.
Briefly, prior to the patch users could omit ssh.HostKeyCallback from ssh.ClientConfig, allowing SSH connections to bypass host key checking and &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;.
Given the onus is on the client to verify the identity of the host, this was a step in the right direction in terms of security.</description>

      <description>2017 was a tough one. Nonetheless, big thanks to  for hosting an event.
Challenge: Can you read my mind? No hints.
All you get is an input box:
Checking the page source doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything fruitful. In hindsight the name=&amp;quot;f&amp;quot; may have been a clue, but it&amp;rsquo;s subtle. (spoiler: f for file)

      <title>Generate GPG key, add to GitHub and verify identity</title>
      <link>https://frid.io/blog/gpg-and-all-that/</link>

      <guid>https://frid.io/blog/gpg-and-all-that/</guid>
      <description>But why? GPG signature verification
A few gotchas.
 Make sure to verify the email addresses associated with your GPG key.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to add said email(s) to your .gitconfig file.
e.g., git config --global user.email &amp;quot;email@example.com&amp;quot; (global setting)
 Download GPG suite, which will enable adding key(s) to the macOS keychain.
  Before proceeding, please check for existing keys and make backups!!!
To list keys in secret keyring run: gpg --list-secret-keys.</description>

      <description>Challenge: If you hear enough, you may hear the whispers of a key&amp;hellip;
If you see app.py well enough, you will notice the UI sucks&amp;hellip;
No hints.
PPP (plaid parliament of pwning) puts on one of the best online Jeopardy CTFs. I wish I had more time that weekend (runs for 48hrs only) and a full team, either way I decided to give it a go.
Disclaimer, was not solved within the allotted time.</description>

      <description>Had a blast participating with a few local DC416 folks in the 2017 picoCTF!
Challenge: Can you help me find the data in this littleschoolbus.bmp?
Hint: Look at least significant bit (LSB) encoding!!
In retrospect the solution was fairly straightforward, but, tunnel vision got the best of me. Thankfully in the end I ended up learning quite a bit about steganography and LSB. (disclaimer, it was actually solved by a teammate)</description>

      <description>Challenge: The website isn&amp;rsquo;t really me much, but you can still get the admin password, right?
Hint: Sometimes an error message can be just as useful
This one was really rewarding.
So, the landing page looked like this:
Based on the description we assume the username is admin so let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the password field.
Entering a single quote results in an error, great, there is a problem with the query, we know the syntax and it appears to be injectable.</description>

      <description>Challenge: You found a suspicious USB drive in a jar of pickles. It contains this file
$ file freeThePickles.class freeThePickles.class: compiled Java class data, version 52.0 (Java 1.8) Hint: Is there a way to get the source of the program?
Although this challenge didn&amp;rsquo;t call for it, if you want to disassemble a class file use javap like so&amp;hellip;
javap -verbose freeThePickles.class &amp;gt; freeThePickles
Anyways, back to the challenge. I used a &amp;ldquo;cloud-based&amp;rdquo; decompiler, javadecompilers.</description>

      <description>File existence Useful when you want to have consistency checking file existence, with a bit more granularity.
func exists(file string) (bool, error) { _, err := os.Stat(file) // stat success, file exists, exit early if err == nil { return true, nil } // check for an os.ErrNotExist, &#34;file does not exist&#34;. Return false and no errors. if os.IsNotExist(err) { return false, nil } // error from stat return false, err }  Used as follows:</description>

      <description>This page lists, in no particular order, awesome Go content from around the web. Big thanks to the original creators for their time and contribution(s).
In due time I&amp;rsquo;d like to:
 add tags to the content below
 automate syncing Go-related articles from my Pocket account
 add a section highlighting notable corners of the internet, i.e., folks and orgs who have a tonne of great Go content
  Some items are marked with , these are just my favorites.</description>

      <description>Slowly migrating commonly used items and internal notes to this space&amp;hellip;
Upgrade Go version (Mac)  Always be wary of things you find on the internet that use a combination of wget, tar and sudo.
Go downloads
# remove old version sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go # download a Go version, redirect output to stdout (quietly), pipe into tar and print version wget -qO- https://dl.google.com/go/go1.5.2.darwin-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C /usr/local -xz &amp;&amp; go version # go version go1.</description>
