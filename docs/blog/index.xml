      <description>The Go Toronto meetup, GoTO for short, has been running on and off for many years since its inception in 2013. Huge shoutout to Tim and Zach for keeping it afloat, all the speakers for their insightful talks, the various companies whose offices we crashed and lastly all the folks that come out.
Check out the &amp;ldquo;What we&amp;rsquo;re about&amp;rdquo; section of the Meetup page for more info about the meetup itself.</description>

      <title>Implementing Hugo shortcodes</title>

      <description>Hugo shortcodes are super convenient snippets of code that can be invoked anywhere within your Hugo site. Think of them as embeddable, custom templates.
In a prior version of this website there was a different mechanism of generating the list seen on this page: Go, from around the web
Briefly, a shortcode read in a markdown file containing a list of inline-style links:
[Go for Industrial Programming](https://peter.bourgon.org/go-for-industrial-programming/)
The shortcode snippet looked something like this:</description>

      <title>Not a small tweet, not a large blog. Medium.</title>

      <description>Medium has played a big role throughout the tech world since their Welcome to Medium post on Aug 14, 2012.
Unfortunately, I suspect one day Medium will cease to operate (or be acquired at a discount) due to a sluggish revenue model.
But, if Medium does goes kaboom, what happens to that content? Will it all still be available online in some other form? If Medium gets acquired, who&amp;rsquo;ll really own the content?</description>

      <description>Apparently, I listen to non-mainstream artists 163% more than the average Spotify listener.
My top 12, usually 6, but this year was good imo.

      <description>Please note: this is a work in progress and some items below may change without notice  FUSE daemon, upspinfs and cacheserver
 I lost my Domain keys, now what?
  FUSE daemon, upspinfs and cacheserver The bread and butter of Upspin is being able to bring your remote data into the local namespace, so those items look and feel as if they are part of the local file tree.</description>

      <title>Upspin part 2: Configuring an Upspin user</title>

      <description>Intro
 Installing the tools
 1 - Download binaries directly
 2 - Use Go to pull and build
  Creating a user
 Testing your user
  Intro To access data within the Upspin world one does not require a directory or storage server. Think of yourself as a client, i.e., a user, that was granted access to another user&amp;rsquo;s data.
For the sake of this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting a publicly accessible file that any Upspin user can access.</description>

      <title>Year End 2017</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t care much for &amp;ldquo;annual&amp;rdquo; events, i.e., taking action x because y rotations around the sun. But, I do believe in allocating time aside for reflecting and setting future goals. It just so happens that time is now, and now is end-of-year.
The meetup game in Toronto continues to be strong. Lots of interesting folks. Meetups I try regularly attend: DC416, Docker-Toronto, Go-Toronto.
A few members of DC416 and I started playing as a Team capturing digital flags.</description>

      <description>Background For some time I imagined a world where all I&amp;rsquo;d need to access my data was something, be it a laptop, cellphone or embedded microchip, that would authenticate me and grant access to all data available to me. In this world I could bring said authentication anywhere, e.g., a library or Chiba City, and start accessing data with whatever tools available. Imagine a keyboard, mouse and monitor at the library or tablet at an airport.</description>

      <title>Generate GPG key, add to GitHub and verify identity</title>
      <link>https://mfridman.com/blog/gpg-and-all-that/</link>

      <guid>https://mfridman.com/blog/gpg-and-all-that/</guid>
      <description>But why? GPG signature verification
A few gotchas.
 Make sure to verify the email addresses associated with your GPG key.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to add said email(s) to your .gitconfig file.
e.g., git config --global user.email &amp;quot;email@example.com&amp;quot; (global setting)
 Download GPG suite, which will enable adding key(s) to the macOS keychain.
  Before proceeding, please check for existing keys and make backups!!!
To list keys in secret keyring run: gpg --list-secret-keys.</description>
