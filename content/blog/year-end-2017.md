I don't care much for "annual" events, i.e., taking action x because y rotations around the sun. But, I do believe in allocating time aside for reflecting and setting future goals. It just so happens that time is now, and now is end-of-year.

The meetup game in Toronto _continues_ to be strong. Lots of interesting folks. Meetups I ~~try~~ regularly attend: [DC416](https://www.meetup.com/DEFCON416), [Docker-Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Toronto/), [Go-Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/go-toronto/).

A few members of [DC416](https://dc416.com/) and I started playing as a [Team](https://ctftime.org/team/38523) capturing digital flags. Some challenges were fun, others frustrating, and occasionally rewarding. Each time you learn something new and try harder; some of my writeups can be found [here](http://www.frid.io/ctf). I'd like to continue participating in CTF events and do more writeups.

The year ended with DC416 hosting a 12 hour offline CTF. I was disappointed with my performance, as there were a few flags I should have captured. My problem with this event (and others) is that I get _really_ focused on one particular challenge. The take away is to be less obsessive with one particular challenge and learn to move on!

I've been experimenting with [Go](#go) for a few years and have become quite fond of the language. Mid 2016 I made a decision to port much Python code to [Go](https://golang.org/). Microservice by microservice I've been chipping away, rewriting everything from db importers to scrapers to web apps.

I do believe one should use the best tool for the job, and that re-coding/re-architecting/re-designing/re-w.e shouldn't be done for the sake of shinies. However, with Go, I've found I could write cleaner, more maintainable code. Furthermore, there hasn't been a project that I couldn't implement in Go. The standard library is phenomenal.

Some pkg's I've made heav-_ier_ use of lately: [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper), [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery), [gorethink](https://github.com/GoRethink/gorethink), [gorilla-mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), [errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors) and many others.

In the upcoming year I'd like to get more involved with the Go community and contribute back.

Lastly, the project I was most excited about this year was [Upspin](https://upspin.io/). I've been following the project closely and tinkering in the background. Given there is so much to share and recap I'll leave that for a separate post, maybe also a how-to.

Everything considered, it's been a hella' year.

Note to self: [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), it's time to give it a serious go.
