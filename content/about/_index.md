### About

I enjoy tackling technical and digital problems. Life-long learner. Lots of interesting folks out there.

My age, divided by 2.14, is the number of years I've been a dog owner. &#10084; &#128054;

I enjoy building computers & servers. One day I hope to _seriously_ get into electronics and the IoT

I sometimes run, bike, snowboard, squash, read and capture digital &#128681;s
