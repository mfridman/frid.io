### About

I like tackling problems, mostly digital. Life-long learner. If life were like that -  I'd enjoy an endless for loop of writing code (mainly Go), drinking â˜• and learning something new.

My age, divided by 2.14, is the number of years I've been a proud dog owner. &#10084; &#128054;

One day I hope to _seriously_ get into electronics and that thing they call IoT

Sometimes I run, bike, snowboard, squash, read and capture digital &#128681;s
