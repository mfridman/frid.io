Challenge: Can you read my mind? No hints.

All you get is an input box:

<img src="/img/input.png" alt="inputbox" style="width: 250px;"/>

Checking the page source doesn't reveal anything fruitful. In hindsight the `name="f"` may have been a clue, but it's subtle. (spoiler: f for file)

{{< highlight html "linenos=table" >}}
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello, what do you want to read?</p>
        <form method="GET">
            <input type="txt" name="f">
            <input type="submit" value="Read">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
{{< / highlight >}}     
Moving on... let's check the i/o of that input box

Entering `abc` returns a 404:

```txt
Not Found
The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.
```

Likewise other words, `flag`, `flag.txt` return a 404.

At this point one has to make a decision. Brute force, i.e., throw a word-list at the problem or continue pounding your head.

Took a step back, re-re-read the FAQ for inspiration and reiterated what I already knew. Brute-forcing is almost always not the right solution:

A good CTF challenge doesn't require a lot of guessing, in that it should be quite clear what is the problem to solve after a short time looking at it

Some google searches later, some more prodding, it's starting to feel like a local file inclusion challenge.

`/etc/passwd` (very common file on *nix system) yielded interesting output:

```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
```

Could spend days guessing location of the flag file, but deep down you know the answer is ...

We know a valid file path will echo the contents of a file. Since there are a lot of files it makes sense to get an idea of where we are and what's running.

```txt
/etc/issue
Debian GNU/Linux 8 \n \l
```

```txt
/etc/debian_version
8.8
```

So we have Debian "jessie", which gives an idea what linux files we may expect. Check out [FHS] for more info.

After more probing and information gathering I moved on to `/proc`, a special-purpose filesystem that contains info about currently running processes and kernel parameters. Inspiration from [Discover the possibilities of the /proc directory]

```txt
/proc/version
Forbidden
You don't have the permission to access the requested resource. It is either read-protected or not readable by the server.
```

**Woaaaaahh!!** This is unusual and whenever you see something unusual it gets exciting. Do we need root, issues with mounting /proc? This post is getting long so I'll gloss over some bits.

`/etc` returns 404 and `/proc` returns 403

After a bunch of tinkering it became apparent the string 'proc' was getting filtered. Mash `lkkljhdfproc` on your keyboard and it'll return 403.

More inspiration. [Solving problems with proc], specifically Redirect harder:

Most UNIX tools can read from standard input, either by default or with a specified filename of "-". But sometimes we have to use a program which requires an explicitly named file. proc provides an elegant workaround for this flaw.

A UNIX process refers to its open files using integers called file descriptors. When we say "standard input", we really mean "file descriptor 0". So we can use /proc/self/fd/0 as an explicit name for standard input:

> **This trick is useful enough that many distributions provide symlinks at /dev/stdin, etc.**

```bash
$ ls -l /dev/stdin
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jun 25 10:04 /dev/stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
```

Is it possible we can get access to `/proc` via the `/dev` symlinks? 

At this point it was getting frustrating [see update below]. `stderr` and `stdout` also returned 403. mindreader was not liking specific keywords. `stdin` was an okay keyword but cannot be used.

Long story needs to have an ending, [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment] specifically [3.16 /dev/fd] was THE article to point the compass home.

```bash
$ ls -l /dev/fd
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jun 25 10:04 /dev/fd -> /proc/self/fd
```

We can use `/dev/fd` symlink to access `/proc/` without .. typing .. in .. 'proc'

`/dev/fd/../../version`

```text
Linux version 3.16.0-4-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc version 4.8.4 (Debian 4.8.4-1) ) #1 SMP Debian 3.16.43-2 (2017-04-30)
```

FINALLY !!!! we can access `/proc`

Clearly mindreader made it difficult to get here, so now that we're here let's explore. With enough probing you'll eventually come across `environ`, this Red Hat [Chapter 5. The proc File System] was useful.

Some more probing and testing of various processes will lead to:

`/dev/fd/../environ`

**UPDATE** I never got to the bottom of why some keywords were filtered. Here is a great explanation [Hacking Livestream #23: Google CTF Quals 2017]
