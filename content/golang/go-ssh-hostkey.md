So you upgraded the package: `go get -u -v golang.org/x/crypto/...`

and got an error: `ssh: must specify HostKeyCallback`

A quick google search returns this great post [Golang SSH Security], as well as [issue#19767] and [e4e2799].

Briefly, prior to the patch users could omit `ssh.HostKeyCallback` from `ssh.ClientConfig`, allowing SSH connections to bypass host key checking and "just work".

Given the onus is on the client to verify the identity of the host, this was a step in the right direction in terms of security. E.g., [MITM attack]

**For sake of clarity, neither Go or the docs had issues. It was users misusing the library.**

<hr>

So what can you do?

1.use `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()`, allowing almost any host key to be used.

> It should not be used for production code.

2.use `ssh.FixedHostKey()` and pass in a key from known_hosts file, typically `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts`

<hr>

For an example check out [ExampleHostKeyCheck()], which assumes standard port

Some gotchas, if you have many hosts with varying ports on a single domain or IP address the above snippet will match the **first occurrence**, return _an_ incorrect host key to the caller and `ssh.Dial()` will eventually fail:

`ssh: handshake failed: ssh: host key mismatch`

Another issue is if you have many hosts to check, you don't want the entire program to exit due to a single failed host key check, watch out for `log.Fatalf` which is `Printf()` followed by call to `os.Exit(1)`

Furthermore, for non-standard ports you'll need to modify the above snippet. Because non-standard ports have hostnames enclosed with square brackets followed by a colon and the port number:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
[ssh.example.com]:1999 ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...vguvx+81N1xaw==
[ssh.example.com]:1999,[93.184.216.34]:1999 ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...vguvx+81N1xaw==
</pre>

<hr>

A slightly different approach may be to validate the port: [validatePort()]

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go linenums">
port, err := validatePort(SSHport)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
</pre>

Then pass hostname & port into a slightly modified ExampleHostKeyCheck function: [checkHostKey()]

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go linenums">
hostKey, err := checkHostKey(hostname, port)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
</pre>

Initialize `ssh.ClientConfig` and set `HostKeyCallback` with `ssh.FixedHostKey(hostKey)`

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go linenums">
// this is an example
conf := &ssh.ClientConfig{
    User: username,
    Auth: []ssh.AuthMethod{
        ssh.Password("is{pass1234}g00Den0ugh?")
    },
    HostKeyCallback: ssh.FixedHostKey(hostKey),
    Timeout: 2 * time.Second,
}
</pre>

Once the bits and pieces are in place attempt to connect to the remote server and perform an SSH handshake

<pre class="prettyprint lang-go linenums">
client, err := ssh.Dial("tcp", hostname+":"+port, conf)
</pre>

At each step prior to `ssh.Dial()` errors can be handled gracefully.
