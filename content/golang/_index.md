The Go programming language is fascinating, from its idioms to the community. Over the past few years learning _and_ writing Go has been one of the most enjoyable and mentally stimulating experiences.

I don't consider it the "shiny" "new" "cool" thing, but more so a tool for writing maintainable code.

I'd like to use this space to jot down all things Go, anything from snippets to more in-depth posts. If you have questions or constructive criticism, feel free to reach out <a href="mailto:mf192@icloud.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope-o" style="color: #9CC1CE"></i></a>.
